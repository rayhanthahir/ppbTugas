This project is based on a mobile programming course assignment. The project involves developing an application or software for mobile devices. The purpose of the project is to apply the concepts and techniques learned in the course to create a functional and efficient mobile application.

The project may require implementing various features and functionalities, such as user interface design, data handling, data integration, and more.

The programming language and framework used for the project is Kotline from Android Studio and Room API for the database.

Throughout the project, I will need to apply programming principles and best practices for mobile development. This includes writing clean and well-structured code, following the design patterns, and optimizing performance.

By working on this project, I aim to enhance my programming skills specifically in mobile development and gain practical experience in building real-world mobile applications.
